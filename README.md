## Introduction

This recipe is intended to be text-only, and easy to follow. While there are no pictures, there are links to clarifying source material and videos.

Assuming you've made bread before equipment like spoons, small bowls & jars, baking paper are not always listed ahead of each step. 

The wall clock times are very rough guides to give you some idea of how this could fit into your day. The conceit of this recipe is that your bake starts 10pm the night before. You awake before 8AM for a bit of mixing and folding, and you're eating warm fresh bread at 3:35PM.

Your flour, water, temperature, oven and yeast are going to be different than those used for this recipe so please adapt to your own conditions.

## Main Ingredients List

### Bangin' Starter

  * 20g (1Tbsp) of your [favourite](https://twitter.com/shoelaces3/status/1244252079041974272?s=21) [starter](https://twitter.com/SeamusBlackley/status/1140945355992965121?s=20)
  * 80-90g (3oz) flour
  * Enough water to make the starter the consistency of a thick shake

### Dough

  * 500g (1.1lb) flour (+ a little (~150-200g) more for dusting)
  * 250ml (1 cup) water 
  * 10g (1tsp) salt
  * 25ml (1.5Tbsp) olive oil (a splash or two)

## Step 1: Make a bangin' starter (10pm start time)

### Ingredients

  * 80-90g (3oz) of flour
  * 20g (1Tbsp) of your sourdough starter
  * Some water

### Activity

In a small bowl or jar:

  * Add 80-90g (3oz) of flour
  * Add 20g (1Tbsp) of your sourdough starter
  * Stir in enough water to bring the starter mix to the [consistency of a thickshake](https://twitter.com/SeamusBlackley/status/1135288160823328768?s=20).

Cover and keep warm until "very active." Very active is when the bubbles [push up the top of your starter mix to become "3D."](https://twitter.com/SeamusBlackley/status/1135318460265746434?s=20)

On a cool day this might take 6-8 hours. If the starter is in a cool place then consider starting your very active starter last thing before bed.

## Step 2: Wait until the starter from step 1 is "very active" 

## Step 3: Make Dough (8am)

### Ingredients

  * 500g (1.1lb) flour
  * 25ml (1.5tbs)olive oil 
  * 250ml (1 cup) water

### Equipment

  * Big bowl
  * An insulating lid for your bowl (e.g. plate, wooden board)
  * (optional) A 2nd big bowl

### Activity

In a _big_ bowl:

  * Add 250ml (1 cup) water
  * Splash ~25ml (1.5Tbsp) of olive oil
  * Add all of your bangin' starter from step 1 ([should float with all that bubble](https://twitter.com/SeamusBlackley/status/1135319551812329472?s=20))
  * Stir in 100g (3.5oz) of your 500g (1.1lb) of flour and stir to a paste with as much aeration as you can manage, then [thoroughly incorporate the remaining 400g (0.9lb) of your flour](https://twitter.com/SeamusBlackley/status/1135322614828740608?s=20) with a [spoon or hands](https://twitter.com/SeamusBlackley/status/1135323253348507650?s=20).

The dough should now be a ball that's a bit crumbly looking and [not wet or too sticky](https://twitter.com/SeamusBlackley/status/1135323778886524930?s=20). Add a little more water or flour if needed and incorporate thoroughly with a bit of kneading in the bowl.  

Add a little extra oil to the bowl if you're worried about sticking or transfer to another big bowl that has [enough olive oil to give the inside a sheen](https://twitter.com/SeamusBlackley/status/1135325743607508992?s=20).

[Put an insulating lid or cover on top of the bowl](https://twitter.com/SeamusBlackley/status/1135327738259107840?s=20). 

## Step 4: Wait 30 minutes (8:30am)

## Step 5: Incorporate salt (9am)

### Ingredients:

  * 10g (1tsp) salt
  * Some dusting flour

### Activity

  * [Add some dusting flour to be bottom of your bowl](https://twitter.com/SeamusBlackley/status/1135328857660305408?s=20)
  * [Flatten the dough in the bowl into as much of a pancake as you can.](https://twitter.com/SeamusBlackley/status/1135335652210253826?s=20)
  * Use fingers to make lots of craters all over the dough pancake's top.
  * Sprinkle 5g (0.5tsp) or your 10g (1tsp) salt evenly into the craters in the dough.
  * [Slowly roll the dough into a cigar (still in the bowl)](https://twitter.com/SeamusBlackley/status/1135336356039708672?s=20)
  * Fold the cigar in half and then press the dough out into a pancake again.
  * Use fingers to make lots of craters all over the dough pancake's top.
  * Sprinkle what remains of your salt evenly into the craters in the dough.
  * [Roll the dough into a cigar (still in the bowl)](https://twitter.com/SeamusBlackley/status/1135336969418887169?s=20)
  * [Knead the dough until it stiffens slightly](https://twitter.com/SeamusBlackley/status/1135338079227588608?s=20)
  * Shape the dough back into a smooth ball and place back in bowl with a cover. 

The dough should be ["a bit tacky, but not sticky."](https://twitter.com/SeamusBlackley/status/1135338844520214528?s=20)

## Step 6: Wait 30 minutes

## Step 7: Folding #1 (10am)

### Activity

This is a [fold](https://twitter.com/SeamusBlackley/status/1135343570645184512?s=20):

  * Pick up the dough ball in your "off" hand and gently pinch one edge with your primary hand
  * Pull the edge out and up over the dough ball in your hand
  * Fold the dough ball 4 to 8 times total, rotating a little each time
  * Turn the folded side down and form your dough back into a ball
  * Place the dough back in the bowl

## Step 8: Wait 30 minutes 

## Step 8: Folding #2 (10:30am)

## Step 9: Wait 30 minutes 

## Step 10: Folding #3 (11am)

## Step 11: Wait 30 minutes

## Step 12: Folding #4 (11:30am)

## Step 13: Wait 30 minutes

## Step 14: Proofing (12:00pm)

### Ingredients

  * Enough flour to line a tea towel or proofing basket
  * A small amount of semolina or dusting flour

### Equipment

  * Proofing basket or bowl and tight-weave tea towel
  * A dry tea towel or waxed paper to cover the loaf as it proofs

### Activity

  * Prepare the proofing basket or bowl:
    * Choose one of these options:
      * Pretty easy mode: Flour your proofing basket with enough flour to make it non-stick
      * Slightly risky mode: Place tea towel in a bowl and use plenty of flour to make the tea towel non-stick
      * [Easy mode](https://twitter.com/csmagor/status/1253475454180143104?s=20): In a bowl or proofing basket shape your baking paper so the loaf will [rise in a circular shape on the middle of the baking paper](https://twitter.com/csmagor/status/1253473940271316994?s=20). The baking paper should be of sufficient length and positioned so you can hold the ends of the baking paper to carry your fully-proofed loaf in a baking paper sling to the surface it will be baked on.

  * [Dust the loaf with flour or semolina](https://twitter.com/SeamusBlackley/status/1135360486419996672?s=20)
    * In a different large bowl, or by sprinkling over the loaf in the main bowl, coat your loaf all over in a light dusting of loose flour

  * Place the dusted dough gently in the proofing basket or bowl. 
  * [Drape the dry tea towel or waxed paper to cover](https://twitter.com/SeamusBlackley/status/1135361685089210368?s=20).

## Step 15: Wait until the dough doubles in volume.

## Step 16: Prep the oven (1:30PM)

  * Get your oven to 240-260C (465-500F). If you are baking in a dutch oven then warm the oven with the dutch oven already inside.
  * When the thermostat tells you it's at the right temperature wait another 10-15 minutes.

## Step 17: Turn out the dough and score the top of the loaf (2:15PM)

This is getting your loaf ready to _easily_ put in the oven for baking. You are choosing a surface that will help you gently get the dough into the oven and preserve the shape of your loaf.

### Equipment

  * If you have proofed your loaf on baking paper you do not need more baking paper
  * A very sharp knife like a (sterile) razor or a thin paper cutting or Stanley knife
  * Either: 
    * A length of baking paper that is long enough for you to carry your loaf in a sling to put in your dutch oven, *or*
    * A baking tray with baking paper lining it, *or*
    * [A baking tray with a layer of semolina](https://twitter.com/SeamusBlackley/status/1135392534820077570?s=20)

### Activity

  * Carefully turn out your loaf onto your pre-baking surface of choice (if necessary)
  * [Use the knife to score the surface of your loaf. Try to make sure the cuts will open in a way that lets the loaf expand without cracking](https://twitter.com/SeamusBlackley/status/1135394087094312962?s=20).

## Step 18: Initial Baking (2:30PM)

### Equipment

  * If you are baking in an open oven and not a dutch over, you will need an oven-proof tray to throw a few ice cubes in or some cold water.

### Activity

  * (If required) Place the ice cubes in a tray the oven. Do not put the tray immediately underneath where the loaf will bake or the steam will cool the bottom of your loaf and you'll have an undercooked base.
  * Move your loaf into the ~250C (480F) oven. Set a 10 minute timer. The oven will remain at 250C for 10 minutes, then we'll turn it down to 220-230C (430-445F)
  * Do not open the oven until the loaf is fully baked.

## Step 19: Turn the oven down to 220C (430F) (2:40PM)

### Activity

  * After 10 minutes at 250C (480F) turn the oven down to 220C (430F)
  * Set a timer for 25 minutes
  * Do not open the oven until the 25 minutes has passed

## Step 20: Move the loaf from the oven to a cooling rack (3:05PM)

### Activity

  * Turn off the oven
  * Move the loaf from the oven to your cooling rack
  * Set a timer for 30 minutes. *Do not cut the loaf before this timer goes off*

## Step 21: [Photograph and consume bread](https://twitter.com/SeamusBlackley/status/1135402087980789762?s=20) (3:35PM)
